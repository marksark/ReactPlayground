## Learning React

Follow me as I master React. This will be the playground where I test all the features of React that I'm currently learning. Each folder will be a new feature or project I'm playing with in order to master the art of setting up a React project from beginning to end.

Early on, these repositories will follow [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

I'm learning React because it aligns with my interest in leveraging the newest technology to optimize and automate systems.

The ultimate goal of using this playground will be to refine my React skills then create my own personal website using React as well as other professional projects.
