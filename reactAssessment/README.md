## React Online Assessment

This was an assessment given at the end of one of my React courses on Udemy.

It serves the purpose of ensuring that I understand the following React concepts:
  - Conditional Rendering
  - Stateful/less components
  - How to style individual React Components
  - Understanding the importance of the 'key' when rendering data sets
  - Getting more comfortable breaking up React projects into individual components
